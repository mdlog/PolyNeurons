## Migration Guide: Mumbai â†’ Amoy

If you were using Mumbai testnet, follow these steps:

### 1. Update Environment Variables

```bash
# Old
MUMBAI_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com

# New
AMOY_RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
```

### 2. Update Network Configuration

In `hardhat.config.js`:
```javascript
// Old
mumbai: {
  url: process.env.MUMBAI_RPC_URL,
  chainId: 80001
}

// New
amoy: {
  url: process.env.AMOY_RPC_URL,
  chainId: 80002
}
```

### 3. Get New Test Tokens

- Visit: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- Select "Polygon Amoy"
- Request test MATIC

### 4. Redeploy Contracts

```bash
npm run deploy:amoy
```

### 5. Update Contract Addresses

Update `.env` with new contract addresses from deployment output.
